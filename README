nget 0.14  Copyright 1999-2001 Matt Mueller <donut@azstarnet.com>

Note if you are upgrading from a version 0.8-0.11 to 0.12 or later:
 You will need to run the fixnames.sh script to rename your cache files to the
 new names.  See Changelog for more info.

Install:
-2) GNU Make is required to compile nget.  If your standard make isn't gnu, perhaps
 it is installed as gmake. (make -v should show "GNU Make version xxx")
-1) it is recommending you install libpopt if you don't have it already.  Since
  getopt is not reentrant, popt is required for the -@ option to function.
  Assuming your distro doesn't already include it:
   ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/code/popt/
  or a mirror, such as:
   ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/mirrors/redhat/redhat/code/popt/
0) if you have the nget+uulib package, or have uulib as a shared lib: 
  ./configure and skip to step 1.2a
1) d/l uulibsrc from http://www.fpx.de/fp/Software/UUDeview/
1.1) unpack it and run its ./configure && make
1.2) ./configure --with-uulib=/dir/that/has/uulib
   (see "locking note" below if you want to store your .nget3/ on a vfat/etc fs)
1.2a) depending upon your compiler you may need to do something like:
  CXXFLAGS="-fhandle-exceptions -O2 -g" ./configure ....  (should be
  autodetected be configure in nget >= 0.8)
1.2b) if you get strange errors about redo(and other vars) possibly being used
  uninitialized try compiling with a lower optimization (seems to occur with 
  gcc 2.7.*, autodetected in nget >=0.8)
2) make dep  (if you are using a compiler other than gcc, this may not work)
3) make
4) make install

(./configure --help will show extra options not described here)

vfat locking note:
If you build nget with liblockfile, and try to store your .nget3 directory on a
fat/vfat/etc filesystem, you will have hang problems.  liblockfile requires
symlinks to work, and these filesystems do not support them.  If you want to
use these filesystems, run configure with the --without-lockfile arg, and it
should use flock() instead (which works on fat/etc, but doesn't help over nfs,
though at least it won't hang)


nget is developed on linux (glibc2) and win2000(with cygwin), and should
compile without modifications on any system using g++ 2.95 or other up to date
compliers.  gcc 2.7.x can no longer build nget. (Though I haven't tried too
hard anymore).  gcc 2.7.x can however build ngetlite, so you can still use it
to download on an older comp if you have a recent comp that you can use nget to
write the listfiles on (-w option).
