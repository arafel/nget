nget 0.23  Copyright 1999-2002 Matthew Mueller <donut@azstarnet.com>

Note if you are upgrading from a version 0.8-0.11 to 0.12 or later:
 You will need to run the fixnames.sh script to rename your cache files to the
 new names.  See Changelog for more info.

Note if you are upgrading from a version 0.8-0.15.2 to 0.16 or later:
 The cache file format has changed, so the cache dir is now .nget4.
 Upgrade should be as simple as "mv ~/.nget3 ~/.nget4; rm ~/.nget4/*,cache*"


Requirements:
  GNU Make (sometimes installed as gmake)
  uulib >= 0.5.18     http://www.fpx.de/fp/Software/UUDeview/
    (included in the +uulib package)
  zlib                http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
    (recommended, needed for compressed cache)
  libpopt             http://freshmeat.net/projects/popt/
    (recommended, needed for -@ option)
  libpcre             http://www.pcre.org/
    (optional, use if you like perl-style regexs)
    (required for cygwin, since cygwin's regex has some problem with nget)
  liblockfile         http://packages.debian.org/liblockfile-dev
    (optional, only needed if your cache dir is on NFS)
    (note: liblockfile uses symlinks, so do not use liblockfile if you will
     store your .nget4 directory on a fat/vfat/etc filesystem or it will
     just hang trying to lock the file.)

TestSuite Requirements:
  Python >= 2.1       http://www.python.org/
  cppunit >= 1.8.0    http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/
  SUBTERFUGUE         http://subterfugue.org/
    (optional, currently only available for x86 linux >=2.4)


Install:      (./configure --help will show extra options not described here)
1) ./configure
2) make
3) make test     (optional, see TestSuite Requirements)
4) make install


nget is developed on linux (glibc2), and has been successfully compiled/tested
on: linux x86(gcc 2.95.4, gcc 3.0.4, gcc 3.1), linux alpha(gcc 2.95.2),
macosx(gcc 2.95.2), freebsd x86(gcc 2.95.4, gcc 3.0.4), solaris sparc(gcc
2.95.2) and should compile without modifications on other systems using g++
2.95+ or other up to date compliers.
Older compilers like gcc 2.7.x can no longer build nget, but can (probably)
still build ngetlite, so you can still use it to download on an older comp if
you have a recent comp that you can use nget to write the listfiles on (-w
option).
