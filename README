nget 0.19  Copyright 1999-2002 Matthew Mueller <donut@azstarnet.com>

Note if you are upgrading from a version 0.8-0.11 to 0.12 or later:
 You will need to run the fixnames.sh script to rename your cache files to the
 new names.  See Changelog for more info.

Note if you are upgrading from a version 0.8-0.15.2 to 0.16 or later:
 The cache file format has changed, so the cache dir is now .nget4.
 Upgrade should be as simple as "mv ~/.nget3 ~/.nget4; rm ~/.nget4/*,cache*"


Requirements:
  GNU Make (sometimes installed as gmake)
  uulib >= 0.5.18     http://www.fpx.de/fp/Software/UUDeview/
    (included in the +uulib package)
  zlib                http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
    (recommended, needed for compressed cache)
  libpopt             http://freshmeat.net/projects/popt/
    (recommended, needed for -@ option)
  libpcre             http://www.pcre.org/
    (optional, use if you like perl-style regexs)
    (required for cygwin, since cygwin's regex has some problem with nget)
  liblockfile         http://packages.debian.org/liblockfile-dev
    (optional, only needed if your cache dir is on NFS)
    (note: liblockfile uses symlinks, so do not use liblockfile if you will
     store your .nget4 directory on a fat/vfat/etc filesystem or it will
     just hang trying to lock the file.)

TestSuite Requirements:
  Python >= 2.1       http://www.python.org/
  cppunit             http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/
  SUBTERFUGUE         http://subterfugue.org/
    (optional, currently only available for x86 linux >=2.4)


Install:      (./configure --help will show extra options not described here)
1) ./configure
2) make
3) make test     (optional, see TestSuite Requirements)
4) make install


nget is developed on linux (glibc2) and win2000(with cygwin), and should
compile without modifications on any system using g++ 2.95 or other up to date
compliers.  gcc 2.7.x can no longer build nget. (Though I haven't tried too
hard anymore).  gcc 2.7.x can however build ngetlite, so you can still use it
to download on an older comp if you have a recent comp that you can use nget to
write the listfiles on (-w option).
