Thanks for the post!  I had requested this a while ago.
Sadly, I don't have any later episodes either.

One suggestion: you used a very large file "Max Default 
Lines Per Part" (of 7000 I suspect) in powerpost.  This 
can hurt propagation.  On news.rcn.com, for instance,
only 50% of your segments came through.  It seems that 
a "Max Default Lines Per Part" of around 2000 (for yEnc 
posts) is more likely to succeed.

Everything came through fine on easynews in any event.
